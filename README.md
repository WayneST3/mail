This is an example of a mail sending project.

Before starting the project, in the application.yml file you should specify the mail from which you want to send messages and the password for it (usually for external applications, for example for our service, an external password for the mailbox is used, more detailed information can be found here https://help.ru/mail/security/protection/external/).

Here there is only one endpoint for sending a message to a specific email.
For ease of use, swagger documentation has been added and is available at url: http://localhost:8080/
